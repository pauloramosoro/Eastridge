# Project with Flask Eastridge

## Introduction:
#### The intention of the application is to create a list of items from any shop to then store the data in MySql database called "flask_invoice" and then proceed to do something with the data. It can be a machine learning model or a visualization dashboard to have some stats about the products sold in the shop.
